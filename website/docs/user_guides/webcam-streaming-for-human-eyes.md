There are a few critical differences between the Premium Streaming and the Basic Streaming:

| | Premium Streaming | Basic Streaming |
|-|-------|---------|
| Frame rate | **25 FPS (25 frames per second)** | **0.1 FPS (1 frame per 10 seconds)** |
| Eligibility | **Pro subscribers only** | **Pro subscribers and Free users** |
| Availability | Always available, even when the printer is idle | Available only when the printer is printing |
| Bandwidth usage | Highly efficient | Not so much. Use about 5x more bandwidth |

:::info
The Premium Streaming is based on H.264 video encoding, which is highly efficient in network bandwidth.
:::

:::info
The Basic Streaming is based on JPEG encoding, which uses 5x more network bandwidth and mobile data, which may be important when you are on the cellular network.
:::

:::info
The Premium Streaming uses a great amount of resources on The Spaghetti Detective server, such as the cloud storage and the network bandwidth. This is why we can make it available only to the Pro subscribers.
