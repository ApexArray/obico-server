---

If you are already using the *Access Anywhere - The Spaghetti Detective* plugin in OctoPrint, you are in luck. We have made it very easy for you to move to Obico.

## Migrate to *Obico for OctoPrint* plugin in 3 easy steps

### Step 1. Uninstall the *Access Anywhere - The Spaghetti Detective* plugin but keep the data

1. Open OctoPrint settings page by clicking the wrench icon (**üîß**).
1. Scroll down the navigation bar on the left side.
1. Click "Plugin Manager" tab.
1. Click the trash can icon (**üóëÔ∏è**) next to "Access Anywhere - The Spaghetti Detective".
1. Click the "Uninstall" (**NOT "Uninstall & clean up data"**) button.

:::caution
Do NOT click the "Uninstall & clean up data" button. Otherwise it'll take quite a few more steps to migrate to Obico.
