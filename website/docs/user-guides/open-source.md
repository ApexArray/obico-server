title: Set up your own TSD private server
---

Surprise Surprise! The Spaghetti Detective is actually open source. From the plugin to the backend to the algorithm, every single bit (pun intended) of it.

An old PC is a perfect machine to run TSD server on. With a few tweaks you can also [run it on a 4gb Jetson Nano](https://www.thespaghettidetective.com/blog/2021/06/06/nvidia-jetson-nano-fun-project-3d-printing).

Get to [TSD source code repo](https://github.com/TheSpaghettiDetective/TheSpaghettiDetective) and follow the instructions to set up your own server.

If you are running a print farm and you need technical support to set up and maintain your TSD server, please [contact us](mailto:support@thespaghettidetective.com).

Oh - and we would really appreciate it if you can buy us a couple coffees each month:
