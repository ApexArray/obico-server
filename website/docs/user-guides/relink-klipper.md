title: Re-link Klipper-based printer
---

Re-linking process is very similar to [the initial setup process](/user-guides/klipper-setup.md).

1. SSH to the Raspberry Pi your Klipper runs on.
2. Run:

```bash
    cd ~/moonraker-obico
    ./install.sh
```

3. You will be asked to confirm your Moonraker host and port, exactly the same the initial setup process.
4. The installation script will bring you to the final step to enter the 6-digit code. Find the code in the same way as in the  initial setup process.
