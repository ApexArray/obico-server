February 19th, 2020 is a special day for The Spaghetti Detective. It is the day when The Detective watched her 5,000,000th print hour.

I clearly remember when I put The Spaghetti Detective beta online about the same time last year. I opened the server log to wait (patiently) for the 1st user to sign up. It took hours (thank god it was not days).

I clearly remember the dopamine run when I saw in the server log The Detective was called upon duty to check the very first webcam image for failure.

And I clearly remember when we reached 1000 print hours. It was a little more than 1 months after the beta launch. I went home and opened a bottle of champagne. But with or without the alcohol, my brain didn't have the capacity to just imagine what 5,000,000 print hours would look like.

And now, a little less than 1 year after the beta launch, 5,000,000th print hour is here. That doesn't even include the print hours watched on the private servers. This is a clear indication for the level of enthusiasm our fellow 3D printing hobbyists have toward The Spaghetti Detective.

Thank you everyone for being part of this amazing ride, for helping each other in the discord forum, for reporting bugs and helping us fix it, for bearing with the imperfection of our AI model, and for writing to us to simply cheer on the team.

The Detective wouldn't be where she is today without you, our lovely users!

Cheers,
