Effective **March 10th, 2020**, the Unlimited Detective Hour Pack will no longer be available to Pro subscribers. It'll be replaced by a 2000 Detective Hours / month Pack at the same price.

The Pro subscribers who have subscribed to the Unlimited Detective Hour Pack on or before that day will not be impacted. You will still get to enjoy unlimited Detective Hours no matter how many hours you print each month. This is our way to say "Thank You" to anyone who supported us in our early days!

Shop subscribers can still subscribe to the Unlimited Detective Hour Pack. Please [contact us](mailto:support@thespaghettidetective.com) if you are interested.

## Why the change?

The reason why we made the decision to remove Unlimited Detective Hour Pack from Pro plan is the cost.

Hosting The Spaghetti Detective in the cloud for fellow 3D printing enthusiasts incurs non-trivial amount of cost. [The largest part of the cost is to serve Detective Hours.](/docs/user_guides/how-does-detective-hour-work)

Depending on the webcam resolution and how often the printers print, the price of Unlimited Detective Hour Pack ($20/month for annual plan) is just enough to serve 3-5 printers. The reason why we originally decided to offer Unlimited Detective Hour Pack to Pro subscribers was because we hoped to make it easy for Pro subscribers who print a lot. We (mistakenly) thought 3D Printing shops who have more than 5 printers will likely take Shop plan anyway because of all the advanced features offered in the Shop plan.

However, it turned out, quite to our surprise, TSD's Pro plan is actually good enough for man shops with 5+ printers or even 10+ printers. And we were quite surprised by how quickly these shops started to jump on board. While we are happy to see The Spaghetti Detective Pro plan seems to provide value to the 3D Printing shops, and we appreciate their support at the time we needed it the most, we have come to the realization that it wouldn't be financially sustainable for TSD as more and more shops are jumping on board. That's why we decided to remove the Unlimited Detective Hour Pack from the Pro plan.

## What if I need more than 2000 Detective Hours/month?

After March 10th, 2020, if you need more than 2000 Detective Hours/month, you will need to subscribe to the Shop plan.

If you only need more Detective Hours, but not other features in the Shop plan, you can [contact us](mailto:support@thespaghettidetective.com) and let us know how many printers you have and how many Detective Hours you need per month. We will be happy to provide you with a quote at a reduced rate compared to a regular Shop plan.

## What if I already have an Unlimited Detective Hour Pack?

Again existing Unlimited Detective Hour Pack subscribers are not impacted. Enjoy these unlimited hours as long as:

1. Your subscription is kept active;

2. The Unlimited Detective Hour Pack is not removed from your subscription. Once you remove The Unlimited Detective Hour Pack from your subscription, even just for a short period of time, you won't be able add it back.
