Remote G-Code upload and printing is available now. It was a little later than we promised. But we launched other features such as print job notifications (email, Telegram, and PushBullet) a lot earlier than scheduled. Guess we can give ourself a B+ on our score card? üòâ

This is a short and easy-to-consume tutorial on how you can use this feature. Please give us feedback by commenting at the bottom.

## Uploading a G-code file to print

Head to [The Spaghetti Detective](https://app.thespaghettidetective.com/) starting page and click the G-code tab. It‚Äôll look like this

Now click on the box saying ‚Äúdrop files here or click to upload‚Äù (note the 200 mb limitation). It‚Äôll open your file explorer and you can select the desired G-code.

Alternatively drag and drop a G-code file from a file explorer to here.

Either ways it should result in a screen like this.

## Starting a print

Click "Printer" tab to view the printer page.

Scroll down to the appropriate printer. We‚Äôll just use Cloud OctoPrint to demonstrate.

Click on the button ‚ÄúSend G-Code and Start Printing‚Äù. A pop-up will appear.

If you did upload a G-code already you could just click ‚Äúprint‚Äù and it‚Äôll start the print immediately.

If you haven‚Äôt uploaded a G-code, click on the ‚Äúupload more G-code‚Äù button. Which takes you to the first part.

TADAA you did it!

## The OctoPrint side of this.

This is the print we started on our website.

Note the new folder "TheSpaghettiDetectiveUpload" on the left. This is where everything will be uploaded to.

You can start a print from there on OctoPrint itself too
