The Spaghetti Detective is partnering with [3D Geeks](https://www.3dgeeks.app/u/tsd-android), one of the most popular 3D printing apps, to bring mobile push notifications to our users.

## What does it do

When you have 3D Geeks app integration activated, you will receive push notifications on your phone for the same failure alerts and print job notices as the ones you receive in your email. In addition, you will also receive push notifications for print job progress (25%, 50%, and 75%).
