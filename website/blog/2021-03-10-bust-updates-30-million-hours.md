A lot has happened since [my last post](https://www.thespaghettidetective.com/blog/2021/02/27/bringing-the-detective-to-life/). To start, on Sunday, March 7, we finally passed the thirty million Detective Hours milestone. The Detective has kept vigilant watch over your prints for almost 3,500 years of time. While she was busy watching your prints so that you don't have to, this is:

## What you've been up to

You guys have been sharing a series of beautiful prints of The Detective on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/thespaghettidetective/posts/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thespaghettispy/with_replies), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/the.spaghetti.detective/tagged/), and we're floored by the response. Every day, there are new shares and we've got more Detective Hours to give away. Please keep it up - the usernames to tag are below, and we'll give you 200 free, never-expiring Detective Hours for every print you share where you tag Wekster and us.

## What I've been up to

Five days ago, [Wekster](https://www.patreon.com/wekster) contacted me to let me know that he had split the bust model for full multicolor printing. Below, I've included zips of the STLs for the multicolor base and the new, fully multicolor detective.

Since then, I've been trying to print her. This is how that went:

### The failures

![The failures](/img/blogs/multicolor/failure_brood.jpg)


Each failure taught me something, though, and I'll do my best to pass on those lessons. In a series of upcoming blog posts, I'll detail why the prints failed and what I learned from them. And then I'll send the failures to [Fusion Filaments](https://fusionfilaments.com), a Wisconsin-based filament manufacturer that accepts scrap PLA and sells [recycled filament](https://fusionfilaments.com/collections/deals/products/1kg-recycled-pla-filament-black) made from it.

### The success

Eventually, I did manage to print the bust, in a 43-hour print that finished earlier today. There are photos above (I bought a photography tent since the last blog post), and you can see the timelapse here.

## What you could be doing

Printing the bust in its full glory, in single-, two-, or full multi-color. We love them all. We will give 200 free, never-expiring Detective Hours to anyone who prints The Spaghetti Detective bust, posts a picture or a time-lapse of their print to twitter, facebook, or instagram, and tags us and Weskter. Plus, on March 20th, we will choose one print at random that we've been tagged in and upgrade the TSD account of whoever printed it to a free Pro account with UNLIMITED Detective Hours for the next 12 months. If you win and already have a Pro account, you can choose to gift this to a friend or a fellow maker.
