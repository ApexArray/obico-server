The Spaghetti Detective came out of beta about 1 year ago. Since then, The Detective has watched more than 19 million print hours for the 3D printing hobbyists. That is on average 49,625 hours a day!

And sometimes next week, we will cross the mark of **20 million watched print hours**.

Those who joined TSD family early enough would probably remember we had a celebration (socially distanced and perfectly safeðŸ˜‰ ) when we crossed 10 million hours back in April. We will do a similar one this time too. This means **the chance to get 50% discount off Pro account** but you need to work for it. We will make the rules simpler than last time:

## How to get 50% off the Pro plan

1. Use the coupon code "50PERCENTOFF" to claim the discount. See screenshots below.
2. This coupon code won't be available until the minute we cross 20 million hours.
3. The coupon code is limited to the first 50 users who claim it.

</div>

*Hints: We will cross 20 million hours sometime between 12am December 1st and 12am December 3rd (GMT)*.

#### I see "<span style={{color: "red"}}>Invalid Coupon Code</span>" when I try to claim the coupon!

It means you are a little too early or too late. *Hint: refresh the page to get the latest hour count as it may drift away from the real time count if the page is left open for too long.*

#### How long will it take to reach the coupon limits?

Last time we limited to 25 coupons and it took about 1 hour to reach the limit. We hope this time around the coupons can last for more than 2 hours but there is no guarantee.
Good luck!
