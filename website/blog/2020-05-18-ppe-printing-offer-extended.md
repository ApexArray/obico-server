TSD users have been active in [helping the world fight COVID-19 by printing crazy amount of PPEs](/blog/2020/03/25/3d-printing-makers-fight-against-covid-19-coronavirus). Their heroic effort is also supported by TSD's offer that gives each of them 2 months of Pro account for FREE!

By popular demands, this offer is now being extended to people **without a pre-existing TSD account**, as long as you are a member of a group dedicated to printing PPEs.

## Frequently asked questions

#### Can I upgrade to an annual plan and still use my special discount code? It saves 17%, you know!

Yes! You can choose to sign up for an annual plan and still get 2 months free. In this case, use coupon code `PPEPRINTINGANUAL` when you check out. Your credit card will be charged 10 months of the subscription fee.

#### Can I still use the discount code after my free trial expires?

Yes. But your discount code may expire at that time. TSD team reserves the right to expire the discount code at an appropriate time, most likely when PPEs around the world is no longer in short supply (I know, it doesn't look like this will happen any time soon).
