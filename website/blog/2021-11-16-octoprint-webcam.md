In this article, we will discuss the benefits of using a camera with OctoPrint and some of the options you can choose from. 

OctoPrint is one of the best free and open-source software options for remotely monitoring and controlling a 3D printer. Thousands of users use OctoPrint daily to take advantage of its features and create higher-quality products on their 3D printers. The software is easy to learn and simple to use, so beginners using the most basic 3D printers can also benefit from using OctoPrint.

It will not be an overstatement to say that users, both new and old, recommend using the software because of the numerous benefits it provides to the overall printing experience.

## More About OctoPrint

OctoPrint, despite being marketed as remote monitoring software, does much more than that. It can simultaneously monitor and control multiple printers or print farms, capture pictures and videos, create viral OctoLapse videos, schedule jobs, set print parameters, control bed, and extruder movement; adjust temperatures; control extrusion, edit G-codes, update firmware, and even change display themes to create a personalized environment.

OctoPrint is relatively simple to set up. If you haven’t already set up OctoPrint you can check out our [OctoPrint setup](https://www.thespaghettidetective.com/blog/2021/09/25/how-to-setup-octoprint/) guide.


## Why Use A Camera With OctoPrint?

### Remote Monitoring
    

OctoPrint can effectively monitor 3D printers using its wide range of impressive plugins. However, having a camera adds a whole new dimension to the printing experience. The camera is mounted in and around the printer enclosure such that the printhead and print bed is sufficiently captured. The camera is connected to the OctoPrint software and so the feed from the camera is visible to the user who can then operate the printer as he wants. Adding a camera makes it much easier to monitor and control the printer altogether.

### Accessing OctoPrint Remotely and AI-Enabled Monitoring
    

While OctoPrint allows you to monitor print activity while on the same local network as your printer, it does not allow you access outside of your home. [The Spaghetti Detective](https://www.thespaghettidetective.com/) allows you to access OctoPrint anywhere from a desktop computer or a mobile phone using a mobile app. Of course, even with the ability to access and watch your printer from anywhere in the world, it still can be taxing. For all practical purposes, no one wants to sit and view the feed continuously. This is where The Spaghetti Detective’s AI failure detection can assist you. The Spaghetti Detective lets you 3D print with peace of mind no matter where you are or what you’re doing.

You can view live streaming of the printing operation, monitor and control the print remotely after connecting the webcam to the 3D printer and OctoPrint software. While small prints can be easily monitored or physically watched, larger prints that can take hours to complete can be time-consuming and no one wants to be down a feed all the time or guessing whether the print is going okay. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the perfect solution. The Spaghetti Detective employs AI to monitor the print for you and intervenes as needed to avoid fire hazards or other printing issues. This allows users to rest or focus on other productive tasks. This can only be achieved by using a good quality 3D printer camera that can capture the printing process in detail and that’s why we have compiled a list of the best OctoPrint webcams for you to consider.

### Octolapse
    

Apart from remote monitoring, OctoPrint has other plugins that take advantage of the aesthetic aspect of 3D printing. The Octolapse plugin, for example, creates stabilized timelapse videos of your 3D prints by repositioning your printer's extruder away from the camera before each snapshot. To put it another way, you won't see your printhead move during the timelapse; instead, your print will appear to grow from the printer bed. The higher the quality of the camera, the better the Octolapse video.

## 3D Printer Cameras Types for OctoPrint

There are two types of cameras most commonly used with OctoPrint - USB Webcams and Raspberry Pi cameras. We will discuss them in detail and provide some of our top picks below:
