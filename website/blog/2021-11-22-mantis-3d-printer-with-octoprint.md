## The Mantis 3D Printer

  

All of us at The Spaghetti Detective love 3D printing, OctoPrint, and Raspberry Pi’s, so when we heard about a new 3D printer manufacturer offering a 3D printer with OctoPrint, and a Raspberry Pi pre-installed, we were interested! [Mantis 3D Printer](https://mantis3dprinter.com/) is using OctoPrint, a Raspberry Pi, and their own custom software with a goal of offering “the world’s easiest to use 3D printer.”

  
We connected with Joe a few months back and were intrigued because Mantis is one of the first 3D printers to come with OctoPrint pre-installed and a Raspberry Pi on board right out of the box. According to Mantis, their 3D printer fully automates the repair, slicing, orientation, temperature control, printer settings, and bed leveling process to make 3D printing easier than ever. Subsequently, they give users complete access to dive ‘under the hood’ through OctoPrint to control the Mantis like any other open source 3D printer.

  


  

While we haven’t tried the Mantis 3D printers ourselves, we think it’s a cool project, so when Joe offered to provide a special discount for The Spaghetti Detective users, we thought it would be a great deal for any users who might be interested in this printer, and for Mantis to get some feedback from our awesome community who also loves 3D printing, OctoPrint and Raspberry Pi’s!
