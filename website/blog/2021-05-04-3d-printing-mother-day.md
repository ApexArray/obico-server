Mothers are, ultimately, the best ‚Äúmakers‚Äù on this planet.  I write this from the vantage point of a man that has a great and loving mother and a pregnant wife who is the mother to my 2 boys with a 3rd on the way.  As I see multiple frustrated Reddit posts about unlevel beds, extrusion issues, and prints going otherwise awry; I think about how those inconveniences trifle in comparison to swollen feet, morning sickness, and 9 months of utter exhaustion.

So, what better way to honor these ultimate makers than with something heartfelt and made by us?  There have been many posts over the last 10 years or so about the ‚ÄúTop 10 3D Printed Gifts for Mother‚Äôs Day‚Äù including [this one from All3DP](https://all3dp.com/2/mother-s-day-gifts-best-models-for-mum/).  At the core though, all of those articles are just inspiration for what you can do for your mom.

The ideas below are meant to inspire and spark a memory of a special connection with your mom.  For example, my mom is really into beekeeping.  I am planning to make something like [this bee feeder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2793432) and [this honeycomb picture frame](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2979588) (with family pictures included, of course).

Hopefully, you can find something that fits the bill on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) or [MyMiniFactory](https://www.myminifactory.com/) but otherwise take a look at making your own creation with [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).  They are genuinely easy to use, and you can make your mom something that nobody else in the world has!

## Ideas:

### Hobby Empowerment

What does your mom love to do in her spare time?  Quilt, hunt, read, or 3D print?  Find something that connects with her favorite hobby.  It shows you understand what she enjoys and you want to help her enjoy it even more.

### Picture Frames

If you print a picture frame, make sure you connect it with something your mom likes.  It could be printed in a favorite color, shaped like a favorite animal, or inscribed with a favorite quote.  More importantly, do not forget to print off a picture to insert in the frame.

### Flower Vase and Other D√©cor

Just like a picture frame, shame on you if you give your mother an empty vase!  Think about stuff that can go on the wall, a credenza, or some other nook at your mom‚Äôs home.

### Wine and Beverage Accoutrement

My mom is not a fan of wine in general, but my wife will certainly have some after our third son is born. üòä  Think about printing wine charms, stoppers, or holders.  Consider other beverage empowering designs as well like coasters, cup sleeves, and stir sticks.

### Jewelry (Be careful here!)

This one is a sore subject in my household.  I am terrible at picking out jewelry for my wife.  If you think you know your mom‚Äôs style though, have a go at crafting a ring, bracelet, necklace, or matching set.

As mentioned above, these are just ideas.  Take them and make them with your own special connection to your mother in mind!
