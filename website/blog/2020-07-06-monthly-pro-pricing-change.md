We will be making some pricing adjustments on the monthly Pro plan as of **July 8th, 2020**.

* The monthly Pro plan for the first printer will be adjusted **from $5.5 per month to $6 per month**.

* For each additional printer, the monthly Pro plan will be adjusted **from $2.75 per month to $3 per month**.

* Nothing else changes. 

### Why these changes?

<!-- truncate -->

We are making these adjustments to bring a better balance between annual subscribers and monthly subscribers.

Although the annual subscribers are paying a lower rate every month compared to the monthly subscribers, they bear the brunt of the cost primarily due to the hefty fees that we are charged by the credit card companies on payments of small amount.

We believe that the new pricing for monthly Pro plan will be more appropriate given how much the annual subscribers are paying.

### I'm currently a monthly Pro subscribers. Do I need to pay more starting next month?

No. If you have subscribed to the monthly plan on or before July 8th, 2020, you will still be paying the old rate: $5.5 per month for your 1st printer; and $2.75 per monthly for each of your additional printer.

However, in case you have cancelled your subscription, or will cancel the subscription in the future, and you want to re-subscribe, you will need to re-subscribe at the new rate. Also if you are adding more printers to your subscription after July 8th, 2020, the next printer will be charged at the new rate ($3 per month).
