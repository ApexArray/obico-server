We're excited to announce that there's a new 3D-printable model of The Spaghetti Detective available for printing, designed by the great [Wekster](https://www.patreon.com/wekster) (if you don't know him, check out his stuff. He designs some of the coolest models you can print). At the end of this blog post, there are links to download it and information about how you can get 200 free Detective Hours for printing it, sharing photos of your prints, and tagging us and Wekster. You might even win a whole year of Pro service on us. Share and enjoy!

## How the model came to be

Two weeks ago, I contacted Kenneth Jiang, the creator of The Spaghetti Detective, and said that it would be cool to work with a 3D designer to make a 3D printable version of our mascot, The Detective. I'd been contributing code to The Spaghetti Detective infrequently for about a year, and over that time it's become indispensable to me, and I thought a sculpt would be a cool thing to give back to the community that helped it grow. Kenneth liked the idea and told me to run with it.

I reached out to Wekster and told him what I had in mind (a stylized, film noir-style sculpt of The Detective herself, with a silhouette similar to the logo), and he liked it and agreed to try. A few days later, he sent a concept he was toying with:

I was blown away; I couldn't look at TSD's logo anymore without seeing that haircut in her silhouette. 

A couple prototypes and about a week later, he had a beautiful little bust that was support free, had the eyes and hat ribbon separated for multicolor (so I could print them glow-in-the-dark), and had a base ready with our logo:

## The print

</div>

I wanted to print her in TSD's colors (black, white, and purple) and to make her eyes and hat ribbon glow in the dark so that, in appropriately noirish conditions, she'd look like our silhouette, a dark detective with glowing eyes and an upturned collar. For this, I chose [FilamentPM's graphite black PLA](https://shop.filamentpm.com/filament-pm-pla-graphite-black-1-75-mm-0-5-kg) for its dark glittery intrigue, [Fusion Filaments' beautiful Plutonic Purple HTPLA](https://fusionfilaments.com/collections/high-performance-refill-spools/products/1kg-htpla-filament-plutonic-purple) for the bust (printed at a high temperature for extra sheen), and [MatterHackers' blue glow in the dark PLA](https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/blue-glow-in-the-dark-pla-filament-175mm/sk/MPXTSP38) for the glowy bits. This is how she turned out:
