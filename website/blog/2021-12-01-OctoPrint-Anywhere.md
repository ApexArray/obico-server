OctoPrint is a Raspberry Pi-based open-source software application that allows you to monitor and control your 3D printer remotely. It was created by Gina Häußge in 2012, and since then it is being constantly updated and upgraded by its active community of supporters and developers to include a wide range of features.

It is a free tool used by thousands of rookies as well as professionals to enhance their 3D printing experience.

## Accessing OctoPrint Anywhere

3D printers, particularly FDM printers, necessitate a great deal of trial and error when printing parts. It also necessitates constant attention and monitoring in case a print fails in the middle of the process. There can be a variety of reasons for a print failure, which is beyond the scope of this article, but those failures can result in a waste of time, effort, materials, and money.

Also, it is not uncommon for the print to fail in the first few layers, but because the printer is left unattended, the material continues to deposit creating filament spaghettis, wasting a large amount of material on a failed print.

Such things are easily avoidable, but they will require you to spend a significant amount of time staring at the printing process. Furthermore, when you have multiple printers running multiple prints, the problem only gets worse.

Most of you are probably using OctoPrint to overcome these problems and control your 3D printers from the comfort of your office or home, but this is not a complete solution to your problems.

  

### OctoPrint limitations

The use of OctoPrint can significantly reduce the effort required to be present in front of a printer or multiple printers. However, it still leaves many questions unanswered. OctoPrint is built to interact with the 3D printer and control it, but the 3D printer is not built to interact with OctoPrint at all instances. For example, in case of a failed print, the 3D printer is not able to communicate the failure and OctoPrint is not able to autonomously take any corrective action like pause, stop, or end the printing operation.

Furthermore, OctoPrint connections are usually through USB connections which slows down connection speeds when compared to other cloud-based solutions. This problem aggravates when controlling multiple printers, the communication speed slows down even more.

Both of these limitations detract from the OctoPrint user experience, leaving them wanting more.

### What is the solution?

OctoPrint is the obvious solution for taking control of your 3D printers, but its many limitations prevent it from ensuring successful prints every time. Users like you require a lot more dependability from an application that manages, monitors, and controls multiple 3D printers. The savior comes in the form of OctoPrint plugins. As most of you are probably aware that OctoPrint has a plethora of plugins that expand its capabilities. In the case of the issues mentioned above, there is one plugin that provides the ideal solution to all print failure issues while also providing additional benefits.

### The Spaghetti Detective (formerly OctoPrint Anywhere)

[The Spaghetti Detective](https://www.thespaghettidetective.com/) is the best way to access OctoPrint Anywhere. It is the upgraded version of the well-known OctoPrint Anywhere plugin. The team behind The Spaghetti Detective plugin is the same and they introduced the new plugin back in 2019.

The new plugin expands on its predecessor, retaining all previous beneficial features, eliminating its drawbacks while also adding new ones. It provides the best remote monitoring and webcam streaming plugin, and it can also start, pause, and cancel your prints at any time and from any location! You can upload files and kick-off prints from your phone, desktop, or tablet.

It is one of the select few plugins that employs an AI engine to monitor the prints. The AI engine can intervene in the event of failures, spaghettis, or even fire hazards and take corrective action like stopping the print. These unprecedented features are a must-have for each one of you to safely access your printers from anywhere.

## More Plugins For Accessing OctoPrint Anywhere/Remotely
