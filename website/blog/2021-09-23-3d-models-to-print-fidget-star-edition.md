## 3D Models to Print: Fidget Star Edition 

3D printing enables makers to create some absolutely amazing things. Whether for practical use or just for fun, it's always amazing to see what you can make with a 3D printer.

If you have a 3D printer yourself, it can be exhausting trying to find models on some of the popular sites like [thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com) so I am highlighting a couple of fun 3D models that I have really enjoyed printing recently. 

Check out the timelapse video created using Octolapse and watch [The Spaghetti Detective's](https://thespaghettidetective.com?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=3d_models&utm_campaign=test_1) viral tik tok video that got over 50 million views on its [Tik Tok account](https://www.tiktok.com/@thespaghettidetective) to get a sense of what these fidgets are all about.  Want to print these fidgets yourself? We'll show you where to get the files below so you can do just that. 

## The Fractal Fidget Star and its attachments
Our absolute favorite fidget is by far the [8-pointed fractal fidget star](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4802126) and the attachments that go with it designed by Chuck Hilliard (known as [chuuckaduuck on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/chuuckaduuck/designs) and social media). This is by far the most popular of all the fractal fidgets (maybe because it has a cool 3D printable attachment to go with it).

**The fractal fidget stars look awesome in this timelapse video:**

I  made a giant fidget star for my grandma and posted it on our Tik Tok account a few months ago and it just hit 50 million views. Check it out:

## Where do I get the STL files?
You can get the STL file for the  **8-Pointed Fractal Fidget Star** on [thingiverse here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4802126) or on [My Mini Factory here.](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-fidget-star-162128)

**Tips for printing the fidget star** 

 - Take it slow especially on the first layer to ensure proper adhesion. We have printed these from 5-25% infill with success at all levels.

**The fractal fidget attachments** can also be found on [Thingiverse here.](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4885047) 

**Tips for printing the attachments** 
 - Begin with 'A1A String Attachment' to calibrate the fitting to your print. Adjust the X and Y axis in .1mm increments until satisfied with fit. Sometimes it is easier to release an attachment by pushing it through rather than pulling it out.
