## Not-So-Frequently-Asked Questions

* If I share my post to other groups and get likes. Will these likes also be counted?

Yes. We will count all likes you receive from sharing the video in other groups, as well as on your own Facebook feed. But again, please share the post **directly from The Spaghettilapse Contest Facebook Group**. Otherwise we may not be able to count your likes.

* Who can participate in the Contest?

Anyone. Even if you don't have a TSD account.

* Who can vote?

Anyone with a Facebook account.

* Besides winning the prizes, what other things can I get from participating in the contest?

We will broadcast to thousands of The Spaghetti Detective users to vote for the time-lapse. Great chance to get some more exposure for your Facebook account and make more friends!

Also if you are one of the winners, your name will be mentioned in our next month's news letter. If you want us to backlink to your own home page in the newsletter, you can reach out to me for special request.

* I already have a Pro account and I win. Can I get something else as the prize?

Yes. Reach out to me for a different prize that will make you happy. :)

* I am running my own private TSD server so I don't need a Pro account. Can I get something else as the prize?

Yes. Reach out to me for a different prize that will make you happy. :)

* Do I have to use the time-lapse downloaded from The Spaghetti Detective to participate?

No. You can use your own time-lapses, such as the ones produced by Octolapse. However if you upload a cat video, we will probably delete it unless it's a cat eating spaghetti. :)
